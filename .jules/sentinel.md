## 2025-02-28 - [DoS Prevention] Add timeouts to HTTP Server in Go

**Vulnerability:** The default `http.Server` configured implicitly via `gin.Engine.Run()` has no `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, or `IdleTimeout`. This allows malicious clients to perform Slowloris Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by sending requests very slowly and exhausting server resources.

**Learning:** It is a common misconfiguration in Go HTTP applications to use default server configurations. This leaves the application highly vulnerable to resource exhaustion.

**Prevention:** Always instantiate a custom `&http.Server{}` and configure `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, and `IdleTimeout` explicitly before calling `ListenAndServe`.
